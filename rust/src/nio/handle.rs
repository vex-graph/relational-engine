//! DEFINITION: Handle is a generation-tagged identity for a reusable typed slot.
//! The index is a pool-local LOCATION; the generation distinguishes reuses, so a
//! handle whose slot was removed and reused is rejected as stale. A zero handle
//! is invalid and never issued. Identity is local to its original owner; another
//! chunk/pool can issue the same pair. A Handle owns nothing and borrows nothing: it is
//! valid only while its slot is live and its generation still matches.
//! OVERVIEW: #[repr(C)] Handle { index: usize, generation: u32 }.
//! API: new/zero/index/generation/is_zero/to_string/to_string_struct.
//! No owning class here; the owning TypedChunk/TypedPool validates the handle.
